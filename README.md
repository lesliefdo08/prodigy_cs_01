Caesar Cipher Encoder & Decoder (Python)

This is a simple Python script that allows users to encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. It takes a message and a numeric shift value as input and shifts each letter accordingly to perform encryption or decryption.

Features:

* Supports both encryption and decryption
* Accepts custom shift values
* Keeps non-alphabet characters unchanged
* Works with both uppercase and lowercase input

Sample Terminal Output:

1. Encryption Example
   Input Message: Welcome
   Shift Value: 3
   Encrypted Output: Zhofrph

Each letter in the original message is shifted 3 positions forward in the alphabet.

2. Decryption Example
   Input Message: Zhofrph
   Shift Value: 3
   Decrypted Output: Welcome

The program shifts each letter 3 positions backward to retrieve the original message.

How to Run:

Save the code in a file called `task_01.py` and run it using Python. You will be asked to enter a message and a shift value. The program will then print the encrypted and decrypted results.
